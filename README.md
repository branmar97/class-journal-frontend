# class-journal-frontend

A single page application ("SPA") for creating class journal entries. Think of this as a digital diary that everyone can write in to share thoughts and memories. Users read, create and delete entries, as well as write entry comments.

NOTE: This is the frontend, view the backend repo by clicking [here](https://github.com/branmar97/class-journal-backend).

## Built With

Ruby-on-Rails, HTML & CSS, JavaScript, postgresql, and console.log (Don't know what I'd do without it :sweat_smile:).
